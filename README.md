## [Project 1: Experiment and EDA/Hypothesis T Testing: The Effects of Cell Phone Cameras on Ethical and Cooperative Behavior](docs.google.com/document/d/12vBrPA3pSS6so_rlFqotw--Ya5rcz5i39liTVzKKMo0/edit?usp=sharing)
- The world's first experimental study on the effects of cell phone cameras on ethical and cooperative behavior. Participants completed the DOSPERT questionaire on their behaviors while filmed by a cell phone camera/not filmed by a cell phone camera. Conducted through gathering data at Oregon Institute of Technology and Point Loma University.
- Participants (n=60) filmed by the iPhone gave significantly lower ratings on the Ethical questions from the DOSPERT (p=.0226), showing them to act more ethically when filmed; we rejected the null hypothesis
- Won the Tom Owen Award for Statistics for Mann Whitney Testing combined with Hypothesis t Testing for different categories and clusters
- Won the Outstanding Award for Research in Psychology from the American Psychology Association for the study's findings and paper

## [Project 2: Experiment and EDA/Hypothesis T Testing and Levene's Test for Equality of Variances: The Effects of Current Political News Source on Reading Comprehension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDKzWzg_eCTq72nmVNAMj0pj7OsN_0WW873r70jkcnA/edit?usp=sharing)
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cMYvNmzmD0HNCwkUXIO6fUQ2fkO0-mO4xq_kzETDZ0c/edit?usp=sharing)
- The world's first experimental study to see how the headline of a news article affects reading comprehension, political perceptions, and engagement on that article. Conducted through gathering data at Loyola Marymount University.
- Participants read an identical TIMES news article under the headline of either CNN (liberal) or Fox News (conservative) and then answered a series of reading comprehension questions. The study hypothesized that participants would have different times spent reading and scores based on which article they read, race/gender demographics, and political party/ideology due to partisan selective exposure. 
- Participants (n=74) showed variation in different demographics, with Female and Black participants showing much more varied reading comprehension scores and Non-Caucasians spent much more varied amounts of time when reading Fox News (alpha = .004,.025, and .049).
- Selected to present in the BCLA Undergraduate Symposium and currently undergoing submission for publication.

## [Project 3: Classification/Logistic Regression: Credit Card Approval and Expectations of Payment](https://github.com/TheModernDayRenaissance/Credit_Card_Approval_Classification_Logistic_Regression)
- An example classification/logistic regression project determining whether people with certain flags will pay their credit cards on time. (Note: application record csv file does not fit within the 25mb upload limit on Github)
- Using Kaggle data from real credit card approvals and payment histories, a logistic regression model/classifier was created through merging and cleaning tables of data
- Utilized one hot encoding of categorical variables such as income type to integrate nominal and ordinal variables into the comprehensive model
- Model has a 98.8% accuracy with no false negatives and an F1 score of .9885

## [Project 4: Linear Regression and Neural Networks: Wine Quality Model](https://github.com/TheModernDayRenaissance/Wine_Quality_Linear_Regression_Neural_Networks)
- An example linear regression/deep learning project where regression and neural networks were used to find the correlations and a predictive model of wine quality based on numerous variables
- Using Kaggle data from real tests of quality, a linear regression model and neural network were created based on eleven numerical variables
- Linear regression model has a testing score of .434 or 43.4% 
- A neural network was thus created to improve the overall accuracy of a wine quality regression model based on the eleven variables 

## [Project 5: K-Means Clustering: Mall Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/TheModernDayRenaissance/Mall_Customer_Segmentation_KMeans_Clustering)
- An example k-means clustering project clustering customers with a membership card for further marketing/outreach based on variables like income and age
- Using Kaggle data from real membership data, a K-Means++ clustering model was created based on variables collected on customers
- By grouping customers into three clusters, discernable groupings based on the variables of age, income, and spending score were identified. Customers in the specified groupings could be targeted for further promotions and marketing based on their ability to spend and demographics
