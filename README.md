## Project 1: Experiment/Hypothesis T Testing: [The Effects of Cell Phone Cameras on Ethical and Cooperative Behavior](docs.google.com/document/d/12vBrPA3pSS6so_rlFqotw--Ya5rcz5i39liTVzKKMo0/edit?usp=sharing)
- The world's first experimental study on the effects of cell phone cameras on ethical and cooperative behavior. Participants completed the DOSPERT questionaire on their behaviors while filmed by a cell phone camera/not filmed by a cell phone camera. Conducted through gathering data at Oregon Institute of Technology and Point Loma University.
- Participants (n=60) filmed by the iPhone gave significantly lower ratings on the Ethical questions from the DOSPERT (p=.0226), showing them to act more ethically when filmed; we rejected the null hypothesis
- Won the Tom Owen Award for Statistics for Mann Whitney Testing combined with Hypothesis t Testing for different categories and clusters
- Won the Outstanding Award for Research in Psychology from the American Psychology Association for the study's findings and paper

## Project 2: Experiment/Hypothesis T Testing and Levene's Test for Equality of Variances: [The Effects of Current Political News Source on Reading Comprehension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDKzWzg_eCTq72nmVNAMj0pj7OsN_0WW873r70jkcnA/edit?usp=sharing)
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cMYvNmzmD0HNCwkUXIO6fUQ2fkO0-mO4xq_kzETDZ0c/edit?usp=sharing)
- The world's first experimental study to see how the headline of a news article affects reading comprehension, political perceptions, and engagement on that article. Conducted through gathering data at Loyola Marymount University.
- Participants read an identical TIMES news article under the headline of either CNN (liberal) or Fox News (conservative) and then answered a series of reading comprehension questions. The study hypothesized that participants would have different times spent reading and scores based on which article they read, race/gender demographics, and political party/ideology due to partisan selective exposure. 
- Participants (n=74) showed variation in different demographics, with Female and Black participants showing much more varied reading comprehension scores and Non-Caucasians spent much more varied amounts of time when reading Fox News (alpha = .004,.025, and .049).
- Selected to present in the BCLA Undergraduate Symposium and currently undergoing submission for publication.
